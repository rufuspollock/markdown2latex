python-markdown extension to output LaTeX (rather than html) - i.e. to
provide support for converting markdown to LaTeX.

Authored by Rufus Pollock: <http://rufuspollock.org/>

Usage:
======

1\. Command Line. A script entitled markdown2latex.py is automatically
installed. For details of usage see help::

    $ markdown2latex.py -h

2\. As a python-markdown extension::

    >>> import markdown
    >>> md = markdown.Markdown(None, extensions=['latex'])
    >>> # text is input string ...
    >>> latex_out = md.convert(text)

3\. Directly as a module (slight inversion of std markdown extension setup)::

    >>> import markdown
    >>> import mdx_latex
    >>> md = markdown.Markdown()
    >>> latex_mdx = mdx_latex.LaTeXExtension()
    >>> latex_mdx.extendMarkdown(md, markdown.__dict__)
    >>> out = md.convert(text)
